## Description
This is a project I dedicated 3days to as a Svelte tutorial  
aiming to acquaint myself with the fundamental structure of the Svelte Framework.  
At the time, a drama called '이상한 변호사 우영우' was popular in Korea.  
That i thoroughly enjoyed watching.  
So inspired by the characters in the show, i decided to develop this site.  
<br/>

## Using
- Svelte(v3.31.2)
- Typescript
- Firebase Realtime Database
<br/>

## Set `./src/constants.ts`
```
export const SCRET_KEY = "{ENCRYPT_KEY}";
export const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey: "{API_KEY}",
  authDomain: "{PROJECT_NAME}.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://{PROJECT_NAME}-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "{PROJECT_NAME}",
  storageBucket: "{PROJECT_NAME}.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "{MESSAGING_SENDER_ID}",
  appId: "{APP_ID}",
  measurementId: "G-{ID}",
};
```
